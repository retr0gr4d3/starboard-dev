## What is "Starboard"?
Starboard is the name I've given to this iteration of [my personal hobby site](https://git.retr0.gr4d3.uk/). Development for Starboard will remain in this repo, and release-ready versions will be visable on the site when the time is right.

I came up with the name when I was in a garden stargazing. I caught a photo of a shooting star and decided that would be the home splash. Thus, Starboard.
